\chapter{Conclusions} 
The results are all in form of an application from which all the shown scenes are taken, and in which all described behaviour and functionality is implemented. The application runs well except for some 'out of control'-type Solver situations when using large time steps and inaccurate solver algorithms. There were 4 different scenes, 5 different kind of forces, 4 different constraints and 4 different integration schemes implemented.
