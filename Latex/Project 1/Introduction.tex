\chapter{Introduction}

This report covers a description of the implementation of several computer graphics simulation techniques. It deals with a variety of different forces, constraints and some scenes that show a few things that can be created with these techniques. The scope of this report will consist out of a basic explanation of the implemented techniques, as well as a technical description of how these techniques were implemented. This will be done with formulas, images, a few simple code snippets and other interesting technical aspects. This application is developed in $C\#$ (ans so are the code snippets) and is tested and debugged under windows 7.
