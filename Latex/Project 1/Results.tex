\chapter{Results}
The results are all in form of an application from which all the shown scenes are taken, and in which all described behaviour and functionality is implemented. This application is developed in $C\#$ and is tested and debugged under windows 7. \\
The application runs well except for some 'out of control'-type Solver situations when using large timesteps and inaccurate solver algorithms.
