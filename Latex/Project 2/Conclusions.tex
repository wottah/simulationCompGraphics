\chapter{Conclusions}
The results are all in form of an application from which all the shown scenes are taken. Apart from some slight boundary issues, the application works well. All desired features and fluid behaviour works as described in this document. 
This application is well suited for future expansion. Techniques currently implemented can be perfected, and there are several other fluid simulation techniques that can be implemented to further improve the simulation.
