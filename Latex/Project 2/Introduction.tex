\chapter{Introduction}

This report covers a description of the implementation of fluid simulation techniques. It deals with basic fluid techniques, boundaries, rigid bodies and fluid coupling. A few scenes are used to show things that can be created using these techniques. The scope of this report will consist out of a basic explanation of the implemented techniques, as well as a technical description of how these techniques were implemented. This will be done using formulas, images and descriptions of interesting technical aspects. The application described in this document is developed in $C\#$ and is tested and debugged under windows 7.
